Welcome to the In-Game Wiki Mod. As you have this user interface open, this means that you've found the 'i' key on your keyboard :). This mod will give you as much as possible information about blocks/items/entities/mechanics/.... in the game. The mod is designed to give other mods the opportunity to add info about their own mods via this mod.

If you are a modder or a wiki page writer and want to know how to add content, make sure 'debug mode' is enabled in the config of this mod. Then you'll notice wikipages beginning with 'dev:' become available. These will guide you further.
