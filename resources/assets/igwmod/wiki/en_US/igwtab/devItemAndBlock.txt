 [prefix{n}]Adding content to the Item & Block or Entity tab [prefix{}]
 To add content to the Item & Block tab or Entity tab you don't have to add any code. This can be done by adding .txt files in the right places. If you look at the tooltip of any item/block you'll notice an extra line has appeared with "IGW-Mod_DEBUG IGW name: x". The name that appears there should be the name of the .txt file, and it should be placed in "assets/igwmod/wiki/". So for example, when you want to add info for a Piston, the tooltip tells you the name is "block/pistonBase". So the .txt file should be named "pistonBase", and the file should be placed in "assets/igwmod/wiki/block/", making the full path "assets/igwmod/wiki/block/pistonBase.txt".
 
 [prefix{n}]Exceptions [prefix{}]
 There are blocks/items where this system doesn't work that great with. For example, take a look at the Enchanted Book. If you look at the name, you'll see it tells "item/enchantedBook". And it does that for every enchanted book, regardless of the enchant. So you could only write a wikipage about Enchanted Books in general. To distinguish each of the enchants, code is needed. If you're a mod developper, take a look at the BlockWikiEvent.java and ItemWikiEvent.java. Note that you then also need to register the item/block page with WikiRegistry.registerBlockAndItemPageEntry() method.
